## Tutorial for how to log into a course-specific account on ieng6

1. *Installing VScode*

    Go to the Visual Studio Code website to download VScode [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

2. *Remotely connecting*

    First, install OpenSSH, which allows you to connect to the UCSD servers: [OpenSSH](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/openssh/openssh_install_firstuse)

    I'm on Windows 10 so I just followed the instructions on the link above.

    Next, look up your course specific account for CSE15L at this link: 

    [https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php)

    I had a lot of problems finding my login info and then trying to connect to the server from here though -- if this happens, you may need to reset your password (I did this three times before getting positive results).

    Your account should start with `cs15lwi22`



3. *Trying some commands*
4. *Moving files with* `scp`
5. *Setting an SSH key*
6. *Optimizing remote running*
